<!-- Media queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, 
they look at the capability of the device.

Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:
    width and height of the viewport
    width and height of the device
    orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
    resolution
    Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to desktops, 
    laptops, tablets, and mobile phones (such as iPhone and Android phones). -->

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <style>
            body {
                background-color: pink;
            }
            
            /* The media query will only apply if the media type is screen and the viewport is 480px wide or wider. */
            @media screen and (min-width: 480px) {
                body {
                    background-color: lightgreen;
                }
            }
        </style>

        <!-- You can also have different stylesheets for different media, like this
        <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-width: 900px)" href="widescreen.css">
        <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (max-width: 600px)" href="smallscreen.css">
         -->
    </head>
    <body>
    
    <h1>Resize the browser window to see the effect!</h1>
    <p>The media query will only apply if the media type is screen and the viewport is 480px wide or wider.</p>
