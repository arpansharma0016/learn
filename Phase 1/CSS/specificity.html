    <!-- If there are two or more CSS rules that point to the same element, the selector with the highest specificity value will "win", and its style declaration will be applied to that HTML element.
    Think of specificity as a score/rank that determines which style declaration is ultimately applied to an element. -->

    <!-- In this example, we have added an inline style for the "p" element. 
    The text will now be pink, because the inline style is given the highest priority -->
    <p id="demo" class="test" style="color: pink;">Hello World!</p>

    <!-- Specificity Hierarchy
    Every CSS selector has its place in the specificity hierarchy.

    There are four categories which define the specificity level of a selector:

    Inline styles - Example: <h1 style="color: pink;">
    IDs - Example: #navbar
    Classes, pseudo-classes, attribute selectors - Example: .test, :hover, [href]
    Elements and pseudo-elements - Example: h1, :before -->
