<!-- 
    
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p> 
The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.
It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>.
Then, inside the <html> element there is a <body> element
The <body> element defines the document's body.
It has a start tag <body> and an end tag </body>.
Then, inside the <body> element there are two other elements: <h1> and <p>
The <h1> element defines a heading.
It has a start tag <h1> and an end tag </h1>
The <p> element defines a paragraph.
It has a start tag <p> and an end tag </p>.

        The most common use of the <picture> element will be for art direction in responsive designs. 
        Instead of having one image that is scaled up or down based on the viewport width, multiple images can be 
        designed to more nicely fill the browser viewport.
        The <picture> element contains two tags: one or more <source> tags and one <img> tag.
        The browser will look for the first <source> element where the media query matches the current viewport width, 
        and then it will display the proper image (specified in the srcset attribute). The <img> element is required as 
        the last child of the <picture> element, as a fallback option if none of the source tags matches.
        Tip: The <picture> element works "similar" to <video> and <audio>. You set up different sources, and the 
        first source that fits the preferences is the one being used. -->
