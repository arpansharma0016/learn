    <!-- The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
    The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.
    The <div> tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.
    Any sort of content can be put inside the <div> tag! 
    Note: By default, browsers always place a line break before and after the <div> element. -->
